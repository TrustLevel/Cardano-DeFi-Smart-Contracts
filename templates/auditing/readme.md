Explanation of the Template (incl. logic and definitions):

1. State Variables:
- audit_log: A list that tracks significant events, such as token issuances, liquidations, and collateral updates.
- collateral_status: Maps user addresses to their current collateral value, allowing the contract to track the system’s health.
- token_supply: Tracks the total number of tokens in circulation, ensuring transparency around the total supply of issued tokens.
- liquidation_events: Maps user addresses to the amount of collateral that was liquidated, keeping a history of liquidation events.

2. Functions:
- logEvent: Records important events like token issuance, collateral updates, or liquidations. This can be used for any significant action that needs to be audited or tracked.
- updateCollateralStatus: Interacts with the Collateral Management Contract to update the user’s collateral status in real time.
- updateTokenSupply: Interacts with the Issuance and Redemption Contract to track the total token supply.
- trackLiquidation: Logs liquidation events, records the amount of collateral liquidated for each user, and adds the event to the audit log.
- generateReport: Compiles the audit log into a human-readable format, which can be used to provide real-time reports on system activity.

3. Interaction with Other Contracts:
- Collateral Management Contract: This contract updates the collateral values of each user using the updateCollateralStatus function.
- Issuance and Redemption Contract: The token supply is tracked and updated whenever tokens are issued or redeemed.
- Liquidation Contract: Liquidation events are logged and tracked to maintain transparency in case of under-collateralization.
- Ownership and Custody Contract: If needed, ownership transfers can also be logged using the logEvent function.

4. Error Handling:
- Since the Auditing and Reporting Contract is primarily used for logging and reporting, there is no need for complex error handling. The focus is on ensuring that all significant events are recorded and can be reported back.
