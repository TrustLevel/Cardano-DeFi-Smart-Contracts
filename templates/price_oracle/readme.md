Explanation of the Template:

1.	State Variables:
	•	prices: A map that tracks the prices of different assets (e.g., ADA, stablecoins, tokenized assets).
	•	last_updated: A map that stores the last time a specific asset’s price was updated, which can be useful for auditing and verification purposes.
2.	Functions:
	•	fetchPrice: Returns the current price of the requested asset. If the asset is not found in the map, it returns an error.
	•	updatePrice: Updates the price of a specific asset. This function would typically be called by an external price oracle or a trusted feed to ensure real-time updates. It also logs the time of the update for transparency.
3.	Interaction with Other Contracts:
	•	The Collateral Management Contract will use the fetchPrice function to determine the current value of the collateral and decide whether more collateral needs to be deposited or if a liquidation is required.
	•	The Issuance and Redemption Contract may also call fetchPrice to ensure that tokens are issued and redeemed at the correct value.
	•	The Liquidation Contract can trigger liquidation events when the price of an asset drops below the liquidation threshold, which will be determined by the price oracle.
4.	Error Handling:
	•	The contract checks if the requested asset’s price is available and returns an error if it is not. This prevents contracts from proceeding with invalid price data.
