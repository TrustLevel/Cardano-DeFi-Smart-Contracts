Explanation of the Template:

1. State Variables:
- token_supply: Tracks the total number of tokens in circulation.
- collateral_backing: Keeps track of how much collateral is backing the issued tokens.

2. Functions:
- mintTokens: Issues new tokens when there is sufficient collateral backing. This function checks the total collateral in the system (from the Collateral Management Contract) to ensure that tokens are only minted when adequately backed by collateral.
- burnTokens: Destroys (burns) tokens, removing them from circulation. The collateral is released back to the user (interacts with the Collateral Management Contract).
- redeemCollateral: Calls burnTokens to redeem tokens and release the equivalent amount of collateral.

3. Interactions with Collateral Management:
- The Issuance and Redemption Contract relies on the Collateral Management Contract to check and update the total collateral available for minting or redeeming tokens.
- When tokens are burned, collateral is released back to the user using the withdrawCollateral function from the Collateral Management Contract.

4. Error Handling:
- Includes checks to prevent minting more tokens than there is collateral to back them or burning more tokens than available in circulation.
- Returns error messages if there is insufficient collateral for minting or if there are insufficient tokens for burning.
