Explanation of the Template:

1.	State Variables:
-  ownership_registry: A map that links a userâ€™s address to the list of assets they own (assets can be identified by an asset ID or name).
-  custodian_registry: Tracks which custodian is responsible for each asset, allowing for off-chain custody arrangements (useful for real-world assets).

2. Functions:
- transferOwnership: Transfers the ownership of a specific asset from one user to another. The function checks if the current owner holds the asset and transfers it to the new owner. It updates the ownership registry accordingly.
- checkOwnership: Allows a user (or external party) to check if a particular asset is owned by a given address. This is useful for verifying asset ownership in various parts of the DeFi system.
- registerCustodian: Assigns a custodian to a specific asset. This is important when an asset represents a real-world item that requires off-chain custodial services, ensuring a clear link between the blockchain and physical ownership.

3.	Interaction with Other Contracts:
- The Collateral Management Contract can call checkOwnership to ensure that users have valid ownership claims on the assets they wish to use as collateral.
- The Issuance and Redemption Contract can interact with transferOwnership to update the asset ownership when tokens are minted or redeemed.
- The Auditing and Reporting Contract can access the ownership data to provide transparency on asset holdings and custody arrangements.

4.	Error Handling:
- The contract checks whether the current owner indeed owns the asset before allowing a transfer, preventing unauthorized transfers.
-  If an asset is not found in the registry or if the user does not own any assets, appropriate error messages are returned.
