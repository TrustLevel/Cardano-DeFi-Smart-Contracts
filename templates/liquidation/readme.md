1.	State Variables:
	•	liquidation_thresholds: Tracks each user’s liquidation threshold, which is the minimum value their collateral must maintain to avoid liquidation.
	•	liquidated_collateral: Stores the amount of collateral that has been liquidated for each user.
	•	liquidated_assets: A list of assets that have been liquidated, identified by their asset ID or name.
2.	Functions:
	•	setLiquidationThreshold: Allows the Collateral Management Contract or system administrators to set the liquidation threshold for a user. This threshold defines the minimum value the collateral must maintain.
	•	checkLiquidation: Compares the current value of a user’s collateral against their liquidation threshold. If the collateral value falls below the threshold, it triggers the liquidation process. Otherwise, the function returns an error.
	•	liquidateCollateral: Executes the liquidation by recording the asset that is being liquidated and updating the amount of collateral that has been sold off. This function could be extended to handle auction logic or collateral transfers to new owners.
3.	Interaction with Other Contracts:
	•	The Collateral Management Contract will call setLiquidationThreshold to set each user’s liquidation parameters based on the collateral they deposit.
	•	The Price Oracle Contract provides the current value of the collateral, which is then checked against the liquidation threshold using checkLiquidation.
	•	The Issuance and Redemption Contract can trigger the liquidation process when the collateral value falls below the required backing for the tokens issued.
	•	The Auditing and Reporting Contract logs all liquidation events for transparency and real-time reporting.
4.	Error Handling:
	•	The contract checks if the user’s collateral has fallen below the liquidation threshold before initiating liquidation.
	•	If a liquidation threshold is not set or the collateral is above the threshold, appropriate error messages are returned.
